title: Week 1 - My First Browser Extension
---

While brainstorming an idea for a browser extension, my group and I settled on the idea of an extension that connects to a user's spotify account so that a user can play music based on their mood while browsing the web. 

On surface level, the idea sounded doable because I have experience working with APIs. However, after attemping to establish a starting point for our browser extension and given given the time constraints, I figured the project was not doable. Matt quickly came up with a differnt idea for an extension that would show all the headers on a given website and then scroll the page to that section, just like a table of contents. 

We were able to compelete this project fairly quickly since it didn't involve that much coding. In terms of my contributions, Matt wrote most of the code for the extension but could not figure out why he could not get it to function correctly. After pulling his code from github, I quickly saw that he had misspelled a key variable to which I had fixed. 

After this fix, the extension is now fully working. Currently, we are trying to think of some other use cases for this extension because it seems like scrolling on most websites is the better option rather than clicking on an extension. For this project, I learned how easy it is to create a browser extension. It is much like creating a website only with a couple more important files.
