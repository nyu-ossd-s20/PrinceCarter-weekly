title: Week 4 - Open Data Presentation
---


To be honest, I don't really have much of an opinon on the open data presentatioe. I think it was really informative
for those are actually interested in going into the Data Science field. I guess what I did learn was that there are many different technologies out there that can aid with data extraction and formatting.
 
In my experience, I often use data in the form of json when using APIs such as Amadeus and The Weather App. I think it is a good thing for big companies to allow outside developers to gain access to their user information so that other technologies are able to be born.
