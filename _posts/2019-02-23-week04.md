To be honest, I don't really have much of an opinon on open data. In terms of the talk, I think they were really informative
for those are actually interested in going into the Data Science field. I guess what I did learn was that there are many different technologies out there that can aid with data extraction and formatting.
 
In my experience, I often use data in the form of json when using APIs such as Amadeus and The Weather App.
