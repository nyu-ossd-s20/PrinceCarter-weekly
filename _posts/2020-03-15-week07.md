title: Week 7 - Coronavirus Disruptions
---

Given an unfortunate turn of events, NYU has decided to move to remote classes starting Wednesday. Our first remote lecture involved breaking into our groups for the semester and deciding on a project to contribute to. With Ben, Mark, and myself in a group, we collectively decided to contribute to OpenStreetMap since it seems like a project to get easily acclimated with and Mark has been in close contact with the main contributors of the project. Other than that, not much has happened as remote classes are unideal.
