And so it was done,

We had finally built our browser extension and it only took us 2 hours. It took us 2 hours to complete the project but 5 days to submit it – what gives?

The bulk of our time spent on this project arose from typical issues involing collaboration. One the first being deciding what to actually build. Originally we were excited to undertake the idea of building a Spotify extension but immediately rethought our decsion after realize the time spend building this extension would far extend our time constraint. 

My intution tells me that this is a common issue experienced when working on open source projects – deciding what to build. I suppose this is because everyone has different ideas and it takes time to smoosh those ideas into a ball of mutual satisfaction.
