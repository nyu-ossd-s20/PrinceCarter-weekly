We had finally built our browser extension and it only took us 2 hours. It took us 2 hours to complete the project but 5 days to submit it – what gives?

The bulk of our time spent on this project arose from typical issues involving collaboration. One the first being deciding what to actually build. Originally we were excited to undertake the idea of building a Spotify extension but immediately rethought our decision after realize the time spend building this extension would far extend our time constraint. 

My intuition tells me that this is a common issue experienced when working on open source projects – deciding what to build. I suppose this is because everyone has different ideas and it takes time to smoosh those ideas into a ball of mutual satisfaction. The lesson learned here is to realize that listening to everyone's ideas is important because it can give rise and spark new ideas in your own head. Additionally, it gives everyone a chance to feel (and be) apart from the development of the overall project. 

The next lesson I learned from this project is that, in open source, there is something to do. As Matt hacked away at the JavaScript and Kyla laid out the CSS, I sat there for a bit trying to figure out in what another meaning way could I contribute to this project. I remembered that open-source projects must have certain files to be considered "open-source" so I settled on making sure that these files were present.

After coming up with an informative readme, I soon realize the importance of a readme and making it look good to your potential users and contributors. Having a good readme is way good for others to quickly learn about your project and decide if they want to use it, or even better, contribute. If you make a readme that is well documented and easily legible, I believe it will increase your chances of gain attention and usage for your project.

Finally, the last lesson I learned is that explicit separation of tasks isn't always necessary for the development of a project. Often times, developers make mistakes and some developers are better than others to in some cases, 2 people working on the same file (ignoring merge conflicts) can be more productive when developing.

Overall, this was a cool introduction into browser extension as well as good reintroduction into software development and I'm glad that I got to develop some new skills along the way.
