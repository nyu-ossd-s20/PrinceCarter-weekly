title: Week 4 - Open Data Presentation
---


To be honest, I don't really have much of an opinon on the open data presentation â€“ mainly because I don't have much of an interest in the field. I think it was really informative for those are actually interested in going into the Data Science field since the two speakers talked in depth about the technologies they use in their daily work which can help prepare those who plan to go into the data field. I guess what I did learn was that there are many different technologies out there that can aid with data extraction and formatting. I did not realize how much actually went into converting and tailoring data to a developer's needs, so it was interesting to learn about this.
 
In my experience, I often use data in the form of json when using APIs such as Amadeus and The Weather App. In particular, I'm building an iOS application that helps users budget for trips and vacations. In the this application, I'm using open data to suggest flights for a user as well as activities. I think it is a good thing for big companies to allow outside developers to gain access to their user information so that other technologies are able to be born.
